# **TORCH2VRC**
### A tool to export simple Pytorch models into HLSL and CRTs for Unity and VRC

NOTE: This tool is still WIP. It is not functional from beginning to end currently. This ReadMe will be updated once these scripts are deemed complete

ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unity Components will soon be moved to a separate repository such that this repository can be published to mypi and the Unity component repository can have a proper UPM / VPM package

*Initial Goal: Support multilayer networks composed of Linear Layers*

*Secondary Goal: Add support for recursive memory layers*
