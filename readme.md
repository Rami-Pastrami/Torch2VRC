# **TORCH2VRC**
### A tool to export simple Pytorch models into HLSL and CRTs for Unity and VRC

NOTE: This tool is still early and extremely WIP. It is not functional from beginning to end currently. This ReadMe will be updated once these scripts are deemed usable

ADDITIONAL NOTE: Certain Unity Editor components are not yet included in this public repository

*Initial Goal: Support multilayer linear networks*

*Secondary Goal: Add support for recursive memory layers*
